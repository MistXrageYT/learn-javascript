# What are comments?
Comments are annotations in the source code of a program that are ignored by the compiler or interpreter. They are used to explain the code, make it more readable, or prevent execution of code.

# How to declare comment?
In JavaScript, we can declare a comment by using two consecutive forward slashes `//` at the beginning of the line. This will tell the compiler to ignore the line. For example:
```js
// This is a comment
```
```js
alert("Hello"); // This is a comment too
```

# How to declare multiline comments?
In JavaScript, we can declare a multiline comment by using the `/* and */` symbols.

For example:


```js
/*
This is a multiline comment

hello world
*/
```
